The proposed project deals with providing basic services to customerâ€™s vehicle when
it fails on road. It is difficult to find mechanics nearby area wherever you are
travelling. The website helps to overcome this issue by providing mechanic details in
one click. The customer and mechanics can register and use same provided details to
login into the website. This online mechanic assistance reduces work and can easily
find the mechanics from various locations. Reduces your time and cost. The main
objective is to provide a better service and finally appointing a mechanic quickly.
Proposed system is accessed by three entities namely, Admin, Mechanic and
Customer. A mechanic can perform task such as viewing request received from
customers. Customer can send a request and can appoint a mechanic on respective
date-time. Admin is the only one having control over both customer and employee
details. Bills of the customer service is also generated in the project.
